# Code Refactor Starter Code

Description

A marketing agency has tasked us with refactoring an existing website to make it more accessible. The existing code has been refactored to meet a certain set of accessibility standards. The Horiseon website is organized into three main sections, including a banner and a right sidebar with a navigational header. Semantic elements have been used to clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and developer. Alternative text attributes have been added to provide information about images in case a user cannot view them. The code refactoring process has been completed without altering the external behavior of the website.
